#For Python Challenge - (Detailed read.me file)

In this analysis, I was tasked with using a Python script to analyze two data sets.

Part 1: PyBank
The first dataset involved financial records, and the goal was to calculate the following values:
1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
4. The greatest increase in profits (including the date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in profits (including the date and amount) over the entire period

The finalized script presents the analysis in the terminal and exports the results to a text file. It's important to note that the accuracy of the data was not tested as the answers were provided in advance. The main purpose of the task was to write a script that matches the given results.

The database provided two columns: 'Date' and 'Profit/Losses', detailing the monthly profits or losses over the years. This data could be effectively visualized using a line chart to depict patterns, trends, and behaviors, serving as a crucial resource for financial planning and prediction.

Part 2: PyPoll
The second dataset involved election data, and using a Python script, the goal was to determine:
1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on the popular vote

Similar to the first part, the finalized script presents the analysis in the terminal and exports the results to a text file. The accuracy of the data was not tested, and the task aimed to provide practice and valuable coding experience for future analysis assignments.

The dataset included 'Ballot ID', 'County', and 'Candidate' (name). To enhance the analysis, additional data points could be considered to compare the prediction versus the actual outcome of the vote count and the distribution of votes across demographics or regions to reveal patterns and trends.
